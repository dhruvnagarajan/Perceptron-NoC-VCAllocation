1) To reserve bandwidth

	In nirgam.config type "BW_GT" followed by bandwidth to be reserved.

2) EXAMPLE: for a 5x5 mesh topology with 4 virtual channels

	BW_GT 0.75
	
	This means that the GT traffic (Bursty in implementation) can reserve 75% of the available virtual channels i.e. 3 out of 4 virtual channels will be reserved for GT traffic.
